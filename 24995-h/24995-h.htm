      Perhaps the proper title of this article should be "The Influence of
      American Enterprise upon the Maritime Development of the first Colony in
      Australia," but as such a long-winded phrase would convey, at the outset,
      no clearer conception of the subject-matter than that of "The Americans in
      the South Seas," we trust our readers will be satisfied with the simpler
      title.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is curious, when delving into some of the dry-as-dust early Australian
      and South Sea official records, or reading the more interesting old
      newspapers and books of "Voyages," to note how soon the Americans "took a
      hand" in the South Sea trade, and how quickly they practically monopolised
      the whaling industry in the Pacific, from the Antipodes to Behring
      Straits.
    </p>
    <p>
      The English Government which had despatched the famous "First Fleet" of
      convict transports to the then unknown shores of Botany Bay, had not
      counted upon an American intrusion into the Australian Seas, and when it
      came, Cousin Jonathan did not receive a warm welcome from the English
      officials stationed in the newly founded settlement on the shore of Sydney
      Cove, as the first settlement in Australia was then called. This was
      scarcely to be wondered at, for many of those officers who formed part of
      the "First Fleet" expedition had fought in the war of the rebellion, and
      most of them knew, what was a fact, that the English Government only a few
      years earlier had seriously considered proposals for colonising New South
      Wales with American loyalists, who would have, in their opinion, made
      better settlers than convicts. And it is probable that if the crowded
      state of the English gaols and prison hulks had not forced the Government
      into quickly finding penal settlements for their prisoners, the plan would
      have been carried out.
    </p>
    <p>
      When his Majesty's ship <i>Guardian</i> under the command of Nelson's
      "brave captain, Riou," was wrecked off the Cape of Good Hope, and her
      cargo of stores, badly needed by the starving colonists of New South
      Wales, were lying at Cape Town without means of transport, an American
      merchant skipper saw his chance and offered to convey them to Sydney Cove.
      But the English officers, although they knew that the colony was starving,
      were afraid to take the responsibility of chartering a "foreign" ship.
      Lieutenant King&mdash;afterwards to become famous in Australian history&mdash;wrote
      to the almost heartbroken and expectant Governor Phillip from the Cape as
      follows: "There is here a Whitehaven man who, on his own head, intends
      going immediately to America and carrying out two vessels, one of 100 or
      120 tons&mdash;a Marble Head schooner&mdash;and the other a brig of 150
      tons, both of which he means to load with salt beef and pork which he can
      afford to sell in the colony at 7d. a pound. He wished encouragement from
      me, but anything of that kind being out of my power to give him, he has
      taken a decided part and means to run the risque. I mention this so that
      you may know what is meant."
    </p>
    <p>
      This "risque," undertaken by the adventurous "Whitehaven man" was the
      genesis of the American trading and whaling industry in the Southern Seas,
      and American enterprise had much to do with the development of the infant
      colony of New South Wales, inasmuch as American ships not only brought
      cargoes of food to the starving colonists, but American whalemen showed
      the unskilled British seamen (in this respect) how to kill the sperm whale
      and make a profit of the pursuit of the leviathan of the Southern Seas.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1791 some returning convict transports, whose captains had provided
      themselves with whaling gear, engaged in the whale fishing in the South
      Pacific on their way home to England. Whales in plenty were seen, but the
      men who manned the boats were not the right sort of men to kill them&mdash;they
      knew nothing of sperm-whaling, although some of them had had experience of
      right whaling in the Arctic Seas&mdash;a very different and tame business
      indeed to the capture of the mighty cachalot. Consequently, they were not
      very successful, but the Enderby Brothers, a firm of London shipowners,
      were not to be easily discouraged, and they sent out vessel after vessel,
      taking care to engage some skilled American whalemen for each ship.
      Sealing parties were formed and landed upon islands in Bass's Straits, and
      regular whaling and sealing stations were formed at several points on the
      Australian coast, and by 1797 the whale fishing had become of such
      importance that a minute was issued by the Board of Trade, dated December
      26th, setting forth that the merchant adventurers of the southern whale
      fishery had memoralised the Board to the effect that the restrictions of
      the East India company and the war with Spain prevented the said whalers
      from successfully carrying on their business, and that the Board had
      requested the East India Company, while protecting its own trading rights,
      to do something towards admitting other people to trade. The effect of the
      Board's minute&mdash;worded of course in much more "high falutin" language
      as should be the case when a mere Board of Trade addressed such a high and
      mighty corporation as the Honourable East India Company&mdash;was that
      directors permitted whaling to be carried on at Kerguelen's Land (in the
      Indian Ocean), off the coasts of New Holland, the New Hebrides, New
      Caledonia, New Zealand, the Philippines and Formosa, but they restrained
      trading further north than the Equator and further east than 51° of east
      longitude, and that restraint remained for a long time to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the Spanish war trouble the whalers took another remedy: they obtained
      letters of marque and pretty soon added successful privateering to their
      whaling ventures, and the Spaniards on the coast of Peru and on the
      Spanish Pacific Islands before a year had passed found that an English
      whaler was a vessel armed with other weapons besides harpoons and lances,
      and was a good ship to keep clear of.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the Americans were taking a share in the whaling and sealing
      industries&mdash;rather more than their share the Englishmen thought, for
      in 1804 Governor King issued a proclamation which sets forth that:
      "Whereas it has been represented to me that the commanders of some
      American vessels have, without any permission or authority whatever, not
      only greatly incommoded his Majesty's subjects in resorting to and
      continuing among the different islands in Bass's Straits for skins and
      oil, but have also in violation of the law of nations and in contempt of
      the local regulations of this Territory and its dependencies, proceeded to
      build vessels on these islands and in other places... to the prejudice and
      infringements of his Majesty's rights and properties thereon," he (King)
      had, while waiting for instructions from England, decided to prevent any
      foreigner whatever from building vessels whose length of keel exceeded 14
      feet, except, of course, such vessel was built in consequence of shipwreck
      by distressed seamen. There was nothing unreasonable in this prohibition,
      as the whole territory being a penal settlement, one of the Royal
      instructions for its government was that no person should be allowed to
      build vessels without the express permission of the Governor, so the
      Americans were only asked to obey the existing law. The proclamation ended
      with a clause ordering that all vessels coming from the State of New York
      should do fourteen days quarantine in consequence of the plague having
      broken out there. Just about this time news reached Sydney that the crew
      of an American sealer lying in Kent's Bay among Cape Barren Islands
      (Bass's Straits) were building a schooner from the wreck of an East
      Indiaman named the <i>Sydney Cave</i>&mdash;a ship famous in Australian
      sea story. King despatched an officer to the spot with orders to "command
      the master to desist from building any vessel whatever, and should he
      refuse to comply, you will immediately cause the King's mark to be put on
      some of the timbers, and forbid him and his people from prosecuting the
      work, and also forbid the erection of any habitation on any part of the
      coast... taking care not to suffer any or the least act of hostility, or
      losing sight of the attention due to the subjects of the United States,"
      &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      Writing to England on this matter, King says: "This is the third American
      vessel that has within the last twelve months been in the Straits and
      among the islands, procuring seal skins and oils for the China market." In
      the same letter he tells how the loss of the ships <i>Cato</i> and <i>Porpoise</i>
      on Wreck Reef had led to the discovery of <i>beche-de-mer</i> which could
      then be sold in Canton for £50 a ton; this find was another reason for
      keeping foreigners out of Australian waters.
    </p>
    <p>
      As no more is heard of the schooner building in Bass's Straits, we may
      assume that the Americans quietly obeyed the laws and desisted; but there
      were soon more causes of trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      In March, 1805, a general order set forth that American ships, after
      receiving assistance and relief at Sydney Cove, were continually returning
      this hospitality by secreting on board and carrying off runaway convicts,
      and so it was ordered that every English or foreign vessel entering the
      ports of the settlement should give security for themselves in £500, and
      two freeholders in the sum of £50 each, not to carry off any person
      without the Governor's certificate that such person was free to go. This
      order had some effect in putting a stop to the practice, but not a few
      persons managed to leave the colony and reach American shores without
      there being evidence enough to show how they got away. Muir, one of the
      "Scotch Martyrs," escaped in the American Ship <i>Otter</i> as far back as
      1795; and although his story has been told before in detail, we may here
      briefly mention that the <i>Otter</i> was hired expressly to affect his
      escape. Muir got on board safely enough, and the ship sailed, but was
      wrecked off the west coast of America. After sufferings and privations
      enough to satisfy even the sternest justice, Muir managed to reach Mexico,
      and embarked in a Spanish frigate for Europe. The vessel was taken by an
      English man-of-war after a sharp engagement, in which Muir was severely
      wounded. His identity was concealed from the English commander, and he
      managed to reach Paris, only to die of his wound.
    </p>
    <p>
      In October, 1804, there was serious trouble in Bass's Straits between
      English and American sealers. Messrs. Kable and Underwood, Sydney
      shipowners, had a sealing establishment in Kent's Bay, and among the men
      employed were some "assigned" convicts. One Joseph Murrell, master of the
      sealing schooner <i>Endeavour</i>, wrote to his owners a letter in which
      he stated he was too ill to write coherently, in consequence of the usage
      he had received from one Delano, master of the American schooner <i>Pilgrim</i>.
      Delano's name was familiar to Governor King, inasmuch as he had taken a
      part in the 1803 attempt to colonise Port Philip, as follows: One of the
      officers, Lieutenant Bowen, on his way across Bass's Straits in a small
      boat, had the misfortune to carry away his rudder, and when in danger was
      rescued by Delano. Bowen, anxious to deliver some despatches, hired the <i>Pilgrim's</i>
      tender from Delano to carry them, omitting to make a bargain beforehand;
      and for this paltry service the American charged £400! The British
      Government growled, but paid.
    </p>
    <p>
      But let Captain Murrell tell his story: "At four in the morning on the
      17th I was suddenly seized by the chief mate of the <i>Pilgrim</i>, and
      three other American ruffians" (they were really Chilenos), "two of whom
      caught me by the hair, the other two by the arms. They dragged me out of
      bed and trailed me in this fashion along the ground till they came to the
      sea beach. Here they beat me with clubs, then kept me three-quarters of an
      hour naked whilst they were searching for the rest of my people." Murrell
      goes on to detail as to how he threatened them with the wrath of the
      Governor, to which they replied that the Governor was not there to protect
      him. He was then taken to a tree and lashed to it, stripped, and all the
      Americans took a hand in flogging him into insensibility. When he
      recovered, he says, he asked for death rather than torture, and was
      answered savagely that he and his men were the means of depriving the
      Americans of 3,000 dollars' worth of skins by their operations, and that
      Englishmen had better keep away from Cape Barren and leave the field open
      to Americans.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then," he wrote, "they began to sport away with their bloody cruelties,
      until some few Englishmen belonging to other [sealing] gangs out of Port
      Jackson, stung to the quick to see the cruelties exercised upon me without
      humanity, law, or justice, determined not to suffer it, and began to
      assemble. This occasioned the Americans to face about, at which instant I
      got my hands loose and ran into the sea, determined to be drowned rather
      than be tortured to death. I was followed by a number of Americans to the
      seaside, who stoned me, and sent into the water after me a Sandwich Island
      savage, who gave me desperate blows with a club. I put up my arm to save
      my head and he broke my arm in three places. I was then dragged on shore
      and left lying on the beach, the men remarking that they supposed I had
      had enough, but that there were more of their country's ships expected,
      who would not let me off so lightly. Then they took away some of my
      people, rescuing from my custody a King's prisoner."
    </p>
    <p>
      In all a dozen men&mdash;convicts and others&mdash;were taken away by
      Delano and his ruffianly crowd of Chilenos and Portuguese, and this
      particular sealing station was practically destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Moody, of the colonial schooner <i>Governor King</i> had recorded
      a similar instance a few months earlier, and there is no doubt that the
      colonials had just cause for complaint; as there is equally no doubt that
      they themselves were not altogether innocent of provocation. Nothing,
      however, came of these quarrels, for although the Governor wrote to
      England on the matter, the authorities "remembered to forget" to answer,
      and the rival sealing parties continued to fight without bringing about a
      serious battle, and the whaling and sealing industry continued to grow in
      such fashion as is here indicated. What it had become little more than a
      generation later is shown in the remainder of this article, mentioning
      incidentally that an American whaler, the <i>Topaz</i>, Captain Folger,
      was the first discoverer of the descendants of the <i>Bounty</i> mutineers
      on Pitcairn Island in 1808; and that Wilkes' United States Exploring
      Expedition of 1836-42 was in a large measure suggested to America by the
      great increase in that half of the century of American South Sea trade.
      What this increase was can best be told in the words of the man&mdash;Mr.
      Charles Enderby&mdash;who was unquestionably the highest authority and
      whose house founded this very industry in the Southern Ocean. In April,
      1849, Charles Enderby received a charter of incorporation for a proposed
      southern whale fishery, together with a grant of the Auckland Islands (but
      that is another story), and to celebrate the occasion a banquet was held
      at the London Tavern, Bishops-gate Street, London, presided over by the
      senior naval Lord of the Admiralty, who proposed the health of the guest
      of the evening, Charles Enderby. In replying to that toast Mr. Enderby
      quoted the whalemen's shipping list, in which it was shown that in March,
      1849, "the United States, whose flag was to be found on every sea, had 596
      whale-ships of 190,000 tons, and manned by 18,000 seamen, while the number
      of English ships engaged in the whale trade was only fourteen!"
    </p>
    <p>
      During the next decade the English did something to improve this state of
      affairs, but their endeavour was made too late, and by the time they woke
      up to the situation the heyday of South Sea whaling was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are so accustomed to take it for granted that the English (the original
      brand thereof, not the American pattern) were fifty years ago in command
      of all sea commerce, that the old-fashioned English sailor was superior to
      all others, and that his ships beat every one else's in everything
      appertaining to the sea, that this fact of how thoroughly the Americans
      beat us in the great whaling industry is never remembered. And whaling was
      and is now a branch of sea service that needs <i>men</i> to successfully
      work in it, for it cannot be profitably pursued with the human
      paint-scrubbers who to-day make up such a large section of our mercantile
      marine; and the success of the American whaling seamen may supply a clue
      to the Nelson-like fashion in which American men-of-warsmen tackle the
      serious business of the American Navy.
